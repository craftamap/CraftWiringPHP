There are many tutorials out there, so just use some of them.\r\n\r\nAnd thats basically it. Copy the Files you will get from git into `/var/www` and there you go.\r\n\r\nNote: It's possible that the Apache-Server do not have the permission to write into the XML-File. In that case, change the permissions via `chmod` and `chown`.\r\n\r\n##Setup the Hardware\r\n\r\nThere your own creativity is required. Basically, you can use everything you want.\r\n\r\nNote: A better tutorial is comming here.\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\n\r\nTo control the GPIO, you have to navigate your Webserver to the File gpio-2.php and give Args over the URL.\r\n\r\n`http://your/pi/ip/here/CraftWiringPHP/gpio-2.php?pin=27&status=1`\r\n\r\nCraftWiringPHP uses the BCM-Pins to control to GPIO. A table of these you can find by visiting `gpio-status.php`.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to use the gpio for latching relays. Therefore, visit\r\n\r\n`CraftWiringPHP/gpio-config.php`\r\n\r\nOn this page, you can create exceptions. Changing the mode to latching makes it possible to send short signals to the GPIO. The time is controlled via \"Wert\" in seconds.\r\nChanging to none is basically like default.\r\n\r\nIf you are using this, the status isn't required anymore.\r\n\r\n##What will the future bring us?\r\n\r\n* Disable PINS\r\n* a design\r\n* Control Overlay\r\n* wireless socket support\r\n* Cookies (not sure if browsercookies or baked cookies)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
